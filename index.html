        <img src="images/mountains.webp" alt="Idaho mountains">
        <p>Idaho is a state in the western United States. It is nicknamed the Gem State because of its rich variety of
            gemstones and minerals. It is bordered by Montana to the east and northeast, Wyoming
            to the east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the west. To the north, it shares a
            small portion of the Canadian border with the province of British Columbia. With a population of
            approximately 1.7 million and an area of 83,569 square miles (216,440 km2), Idaho is the 14th largest, the
            12th least populous and the 7th least densely populated of the 50 U.S. states. The state's capital and
            largest city is Boise.
